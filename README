# 🧪 TypeScript Rock-Paper-Scissors Workshop

Welcome to this beginner-friendly TypeScript workshop!  
We'll use the classic **Rock-Paper-Scissors** game as a fun way to learn core TypeScript concepts step by step.

## 🎯 Workshop Objectives

By the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

✅ **Define and implement interfaces** to enforce consistent object structures  
✅ **Create and use classes** to model real-world entities  
✅ **Add methods to classes** to define reusable behaviours  
✅ **Apply encapsulation** using access modifiers (`private`, `public`)  
✅ **Use inheritance** to extend behaviours  
✅ **Work with enums** and **basic testing/assertions**
